SkillForge â€“ Capstone Project
Project Description
SkillForge is a personal learning tracker where users can:

- Choose 2â€“3 skills to work on
- Break those into daily learning goals
- Track their progress through streaks and weekly review visuals

This project reflects my passion for learning, productivity, and habit-building. The tool is designed to motivate users through clean UI and progress tracking.
