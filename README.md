## Project Description

**SkillForge** is a personal learning and habit-tracking web application designed to help individuals take control of their self-development journey.

In a world full of distractions and vague learning goals, SkillForge offers a focused, minimalist environment where users can pick just 2–3 key skills they want to build, and then track their progress on a daily and weekly basis.

The platform is based on the idea that real progress happens when learning is broken down into small, consistent actions. Users are encouraged to translate their long-term ambitions into micro daily goals — such as “Write 200 words,” “Read one research paper,” or “Practice 30 mins of coding.” SkillForge then helps users stay motivated by visually representing their learning journey through streaks, completion bars, and weekly summaries.

Unlike complex productivity apps, SkillForge is intentionally minimalist. It eliminates overwhelm by allowing users to focus only on what matters most — a few meaningful skills and their measurable daily actions.

 The application works entirely client-side (with optional backend integration), making it lightweight, privacy-friendly, and easy to use even without signup.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React.js  
- TailwindCSS  
- Zustand (or Redux) for state management  
- Framer Motion (optional)  
- Axios (HTTP requests)

###  Backend (Optional / Future)

- Firebase or Airtable for backend data sync  
- Express.js (if backend is custom-built)  
- LocalStorage for MVP version

###  Other Tools

- Vercel – Deployment  
- Figma – UI/UX design  
- GitHub Projects – Task & milestone tracking

---

##  How It Works

### 1. Skill Setup
Users select 2–3 core skills to work on.  
Each skill has micro-daily tasks (e.g., “Write 100 words”).

### 2. Daily Tracker
Users mark completed tasks and build streaks.  
Weekly summaries provide visual progress feedback.

### 3. Visual Feedback
Color-coded streak bars and cards track effort.  
Optional backend allows sync across devices.
