Jasmeet_Capstone_SkillForge
 👩‍💻 Project Description

SkillForge is a personal learning and habit-tracking web application designed to help individuals take control of their self-development journey. In a world full of distractions and vague learning goals, SkillForge offers a focused, minimalist environment where users can pick just 2–3 key skills they want to build, and then track their progress on a daily and weekly basis.
The platform is based on the idea that real progress happens when learning is broken down into small, consistent actions. Users are encouraged to translate their long-term ambitions into micro daily goals — such as "Write 200 words," "Read one research paper," or "Practice 30 mins of coding." SkillForge then helps users stay motivated by visually representing their learning journey through streaks, completion bars, and weekly summaries.
Unlike complex productivity apps, SkillForge is intentionally minimalist. It eliminates overwhelm by allowing users to focus only on what matters most — a few meaningful skills and their measurable daily actions. The application works entirely client-side (with optional backend integration), meaning it’s lightweight, privacy-friendly, and easy to use even without signup.

 🚀 Features

-  Skill Selection – Choose 2–3 core skills to focus on.
-  Daily Goal Planning – Break down skills into actionable daily tasks.
- Streak Tracker– Visualize progress and build habit streaks.
- Weekly Summary– Monitor progress with week-wise overviews.
- Minimalist Dark UI – Clean and distraction-free design.
- Local Progress Storage – Track learning without signup.
- Optional Airtable Integration – Save user data and streaks in the cloud.


 🛠 Tech Stack

🖥️ Frontend
- React.js
- TailwindCSS
- Zustand (or Redux) for state management
- Framer Motion (optional animations)
- Axios for HTTP requests

🗄️ Backend (Optional / Future)
- Firebase or Airtable for user data persistence
- Express.js (if backend is coded)
- LocalStorage for MVP version

📦 Other Tools
- Vercel for deployment
- Figma for UI/UX design
- GitHub Projects for planning


🔍 How It Works

 1. Skill Setup
- Users begin by selecting 2–3 skills to learn (e.g., Writing, Coding, UI Design).
- Each skill is broken into micro daily goals (e.g., “Write 100 words” or “Watch 1 tutorial”).

 2. Daily Tracker
- Users mark goals as complete to maintain a streak.
- Weekly summaries provide a visual overview of progress.

 3. Visual Feedback
- Color-coded streak bars and icons help keep users motivated.
- Optional backend integration lets users sync data across devices.
